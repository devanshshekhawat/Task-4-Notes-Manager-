# Task-4-Notes-Manager-

Hey Everyone!! This project is a simple console-based Notes Manager built in Java.
It allows users to add, view, and clear text notes, all stored in a local file using Java's FileWriter and BufferedReader classes.
It’s a perfect beginner-friendly project to understand File Handling, Loops, and Exception Handling in Java.

Features:-

* Add notes — Save your thoughts or reminders.
* View all notes — Display all saved notes from the file.
* Clear notes — Delete all notes with one option.
* Exit — Safely close the application.

Technologies Used :-

1. Java (Core)
2. FileWriter (for writing notes)
3. FileReader / BufferedReader (for reading notes)
4. Scanner (for user input)

How It Works :-

* The user runs the program and is presented with a simple text menu.
* Selecting Add a Note writes the entered text into notes.txt.
* View Notes displays all the saved notes line by line.
* Clear Notes erases all content from notes.txt.
* The loop continues until the user selects Exit.
